Overall, we really feel as though we were able to significantly learn and grow as programmers. The most enjoyable part of this project is the fact that we were able to use concepts learned from class and assist us with tasks and assignments in another class. It is great to see how complex processes can be simplified with code and how much easier it can make our or other students’ lives.Though we had challenges and roadblocks along the way, we can successfully say that our project is a success. We faced some challenges during the course of the project but we found ways to work around the issues. 

Firstly, we wanted to connect the matlab file of code to an excel spreadsheet of values. However, we ran into several issues with it not connecting properly and efficiently taking in the values from the table. We troubleshooted with this for a few hours, but ultimately deemed that it was not an efficient use of time and that there were more issues if we went down this route. We decided that for the sake of this project we would hardcode the values since we were working under a deadline and needed to move onto the next steps of the project.


Later, we ran into an issue when building the gui. We wanted the entire interface to be built on the gui so that the user is not being “text” prompted in the window below the code. However, each table has different specifications and requirements which makes it difficult to build a general gui and tailor it to each table. This is why we ultimately went with our chosen route, as seen in the video, and did end up utilizing a text prompting window to interact with the user. 
If we had more time, we would have definitely explored ways to build the gui to address all tables. Perhaps, we could have grouped all the tables with similar requirements and built a gui for each one of the groups of tables. We also would have done a deeper dive into reading about how to connect the excel sheet or an external data source (.csv files, etc…..) This would be highly beneficial and useful to any user of the software/code, however we simply had time restraints that prevented us from doing so. 


In conclusion, we found this to be a useful, engaging, and challenging project.
