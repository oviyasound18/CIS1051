%------Table_A4_Dynamic_SI(Input1,Input1_type,Input2,Input2_type,Output1_type)---------
% where input1 is the first value you are given, Input1_type is one of the
% numbers from the table for which column the value is from, the same for
% Input2 and input2_type. Output1_type is the value that you want. Enter
% the column for what value you want in Output1
% Example Find h for P=60bar and T=280C.
%  Type into command window: Table_A4_Dynamic_SI(60,1,280,2,5)
